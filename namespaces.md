#Name Spaces

If we had all our program symbols stuffed in one big name space, we'd not be able getting anything done. Even if your own program is small, just think about importing libraries that bring their own myriads of symbols into scope.

Clojure lets you elegantly manage your name space to avoid symbol name collisions.

There's more flexibility than with other languages, which might appear to you as complex, but hopefully you'll stick to using just the basics, until you need more: https://clojure.org/reference/namespaces
