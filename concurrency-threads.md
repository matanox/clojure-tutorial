# Concurrency â€• lower level

While clojure hosts a well-rounded suite of concurrency abstractions by far surpassing Java in their design and simplicity, there's also a few ways to just get stuff going on a thread. Using threads in clojure is simpler than in Java, but you can still shoot your own foot working at that lower level (same as you would in Java). For simplistic things, it's okay to use them just like in Java or any other language. As said, clojure makes them much much more elegant to use, and here they are:

# delays

# futures

# promises
