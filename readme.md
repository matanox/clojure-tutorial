# A Clojure Getting Started

### Setup

+ Install clojure  
+ Install leiningen  
+ Install [Light Table](http://lighttable.com/)

Test it all together:

1. Create a clojure project from a template:
   ```
   lein new cljs-kickoff hello
   ```
2. You now have a minimal working project. See [here](https://github.com/konrad-garus/cljs-kickoff#usage) for running it.   
3. Open the project directory in LightTable to see that syntax highlighting and "jump to definition" (ctrl + ">") works.

### Why Clojure

* Cleanest functional language, that can reuse any Java library (now that's a combination!)
* Good concurrency idioms built into the language (much more elegant than Java, even Scala)
* [clojurescript](https://github.com/clojure/clojurescript) is probably the best way for organizing front-end code while elegantly handling events. You simply write clojure for front-end code, using it. No more back-front skillset divide.
* Some other startups use it too, in case you are wondering at this point, and it's a good filter for attitude too!
* For the Scala addict â€•  Clojure's concurrency model is way cleaner, well-rounded, and  while at it also more concise
