# Querying and Manipulating the core data structures

[We've already presented clojure's basic data types](readme). Clojure provides a uniform interface for interaction with any of its sequence-like data types . A basic guide to the functions provided for manipulating a sequence is [provided here](http://clojure.org/reference/sequences).

And for a listing of functions per specific data type, refer to the appropriate section in the [the cheat sheet](http://clojure.org/api/cheatsheet).
