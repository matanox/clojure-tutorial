# About this Tutorial

 This is a hands-on tutorial of a different kind. It leaves it to you to explore code examples on your own, while reading and getting inspired by a relatively small amount of code examples. You should start from the [start page](readme.md) and then the hyperlinks let you jump between topics rather than take a prescribed path through. The key justification for this tutorial, is that the official docs, while great once gotten used to, may require a lot of getting used to.

 Another feature of this tutorial is providing you with the smallest possible yet sufficiently useful picture of tooling and environment, so that you can dig away coding like a pro.

 If you find this hyperlinked write-up useful, then it is accomplishing its goal.
